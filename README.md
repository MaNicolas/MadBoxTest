# MadBoxTest

Hi,

Here's my README file for this test :
- The time it took you to perform the exercise:
 I finished this exercise at 12.10am
 
- The parts that were difficult for you and why:
To be honest, what I struggled the most with was sharing my project on GIT. I'm more used to Perforce when it comes to submit files.
It took me some time which was not planned actually.

- The parts you think you could do better and how:
As for the game itself, I made things really easy and followed the instructions. I made it work in 5 hours.
Nothing fancy : No comments in my code, no regions, no fancy textures or assets from the asset store.
I just made sure everything was working fine.

I did have a hard time with the AI movement, as I decided to use a raycast, detecting the moving blocks.
So the idea was to make it stop whenever this ray hit some blocks. But then I realized it was taking me too long so I moved to other things.

For the camera, I used cinemachine and settled in a few minutes. I used a virtual camera following and looking at the player.
It can be improve with some damping though, I still find the camera still too sudden.

- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game:
With some extra hours, I'd go more into details for the AI, I think that's the most important thing here.
Then I would work on some other blocks and traps, but I didn't have enough time to be imaginative.

- What did you think:
I had a lot a fun working on this test. This was challenging somehow but I liked working under time pressure.

- Any comment you may have:
I'd like to point out that I had to install one of the 2 versions you required in the test description.
I hope you won't mind me exceeding the deadline.

Thanks for reading me and have a nice day,
Nicolas MA
