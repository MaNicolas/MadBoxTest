# MadBoxTest

Hi,

Please use the following instructions to play this game: (I realized this morning that I didn't explain how to play my game, so I edited the README file in order to do so).

Target Platform : PC (I didn't compile the game, you can just play within the editor)
Player is the blue capsule. To move forward, simply let the left mouse button clicked.
If you get touch by the blocks, you'll end up starting all over again. Same goes for the AI.
You've got 35 seconds to finish the race.
Once you reach the end of the level, a UI menu leads you to the next level (just a UI button, there's no next level :)) or you can restart it.

Here's my README file for this test :

- The time it took you to perform the exercise:
 I started it at 7.30pm (had to download the unity version you were asking for) and finished it around 00.10am
 
- The parts that were difficult for you and why:
To be honest, what I struggled the most with was sharing my project on GIT. I'm more used to Perforce (at work) or the Collbab service (in Unity) when it comes to submit files.
It took me some time which was not planned actually.

- The parts you think you could do better and how:
As for the game itself, I made things really easy and followed the instructions. I made it work in 5 hours.
Nothing fancy : No comments in my code, no regions, no fancy textures or assets from the asset store.
I just made sure everything was working fine.

I did have a hard time with the AI movement, as I decided to use a raycast, detecting the moving blocks.
So the idea was to make it stop whenever this ray hit some blocks. But then I realized it was taking me too long so I moved on to other things.

For the camera, I used cinemachine and set it in a few minutes. I used a virtual camera following and looking at the player.
It can be improved with some damping though, I still find the camera too sudden.

- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game:
With some extra hours, I'd go more into details for the AI, I think that's the most important thing here.
Then I would work on some other blocks and traps, other elements of gameplay but I didn't have enough time to be really imaginative.

I would also add some ads since it's clearly the way to make money out of this game. Or maybe some in-app purchases like extra lives, so players can keep on playing. But this would be at a later stage in production.

- What did you think:
I had a lot a fun working on this test. This was challenging somehow but I liked working under time pressure.

- Any comment you may have:
I'd like to point out that I had to install one of the 2 versions you required in the test description.
I hope you won't mind me exceeding a bit the deadline.

Thanks for reading me and have a nice day,
Nicolas MA
