Hi,

Here's a small prototype I created for fun a while ago, using the Unity engine. It took me around 3 hours.

Please use the following instructions to play this game:
Target Platform : PC
Player is the blue capsule. To move forward, simply let the left mouse button clicked.
If you get touch by the blocks, you'll end up starting all over again. Same goes for the AI.
You've got 35 seconds to finish the race.
Once you reach the end of the level, a UI menu leads you to the next level (just a UI button, there's no next level :)) or you can restart it.

Thanks for reading me and have a nice day,
Nicolas MA
